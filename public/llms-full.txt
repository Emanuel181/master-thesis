## When does VulnIQ use end user information from third parties?

VulnIQ will collect End User Data necessary to provide the VulnIQ services to our customers.

End users may voluntarily provide us with information they have made available on social media websites. If you provide us with any such information, we may collect publicly available information from the social media websites you have indicated. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.

## When does VulnIQ use customer information from third parties?

We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming a VulnIQ customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to VulnIQ.

We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.

## Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?

VulnIQ will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.

## How do we use your email address?

By submitting your email address on this app, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.

By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us.

Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy.

**Note:** If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

## How long do we keep your information?

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide VulnIQ to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf.

When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.

## How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to VulnIQ or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

## Could my information be transferred to other countries?

VulnIQ is incorporated in Romania. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data.

To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.

## Is the information collected through the VulnIQ dervice decure?

We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information.

However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

## Can I update or correct my information?

The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information VulnIQ collects depend on your relationship with VulnIQ. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.

Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account.

Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.

If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.

## Sale of business

We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of VulnIQ or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of VulnIQ or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Affiliates

We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with VulnIQ, whether by ownership or otherwise.

Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Governing law

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Romania without regard to its conflict of laws provision. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to make claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.

The laws of Romania, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of the app. Your use of the app may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

By using VulnIQ or contacting us directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our website, or use our services. Continued use of the website, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.

We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.

## What is GDPR?

GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.

The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers' data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.

## What is personal data?

Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.

## The data protection principles

The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:

- Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
- Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
- Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.
- People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.

## Why is GDPR important?

GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach.

Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At VulnIQ we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.

## Individual data subject's rights - data access, portability and deletion

We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. VulnIQ processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.

We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.

## Automated Program Repair
[Skip to main content](https://vulniq.org/about#main-content)

# Agentic RAG for automated program repair

A Master's thesis project investigating the efficacy of LLM-based agents augmented with specialized security knowledge for vulnerability remediation.

### Problem statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to Automated Program Repair (APR), but often struggle due to insufficient domain knowledge and a tendency to produce "hallucinations" or unreliable fixes.

## Limitations of current approaches

Without grounded context, even advanced models rely on probabilistic generation rather than verified security practices. This limitation hinders the practical application of LLMs in critical security infrastructure where precision is paramount.

## Proposed methodology

This research proposes an agentic system leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the reliability and precision of source code vulnerability remediation.

The framework positions LLMs as central controllers orchestrating reasoning and tool interaction. By utilizing RAG, we augment the LLM's context with retrieved external security knowledge, such as best-practice guidelines, relevant code snippets, and historical fixes.

### System architecture

- Specialized retrieval methods for code security
- Distilled security knowledge injection
- Orchestrated tool interaction & verification

## Research contributions

Results from the scientific community demonstrate that this knowledge-driven, structured approach significantly boosts performance in software security tasks. Tailoring the RAG context with distilled security knowledge yields substantial improvements in secure code generation metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.

The proposed agentic RAG system provides a robust, context-aware, and knowledge-grounded framework for automated vulnerability repair, a crucial step toward creating reliable, high-quality APR solutions essential for modern software security.

## Research objectives

### Contextual precision

Implementing a RAG pipeline that ensures every remediation suggestion is contextually accurate to the specific codebase architecture.

### Automated reasoning

Developing agentic workflows that can autonomously analyze, reason about, and repair vulnerabilities with minimal human intervention.

## About the research

This project is part of a Master's thesis focused on advancing the field of Automated Program Repair through the integration of modern LLMs and knowledge retrieval systems.
